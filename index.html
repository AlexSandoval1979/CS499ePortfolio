    <h2>Enhancement One Narrative</h2>
    <p>
      In this introduction, I will explore various parts of the artifact included in my ePortfolio. I will provide a brief description of the artifact and its creation timeline. I will argue the reasoning for its inclusion in my ePortfolio, focusing on specific components that showcase my software development skills and abilities, along with any enhancements I made. I will assess whether the artifact met the course objectives set for Module One and consider updates to outcome-coverage plans. Additionally, I will reflect on the manner of enhancing and/or modifying the artifact, sharing understandings gained during its creation and improvement, and addressing the challenges encountered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Artifact Description: Type and Creation Date<br>
      The Python code represents a program designed for an Investment Company, providing clients with two options: brokerage and retirement. Access to the program requires a username and password, and repeated failed attempts will result in a lockout. The program presents a user-friendly interface displaying client names and their selected service, with the means for users to modify their service preference. Additionally, the program safeguards input accuracy by requesting re-entry for non-numeric inputs related to clients or services. The Python code was developed in Module 2 in response to feedback requesting a translation of the existing C++ program into Python.
    </p>
    <p>
      Analyzing Artifact Selection and Enhancement in ePortfolio<br>
      Python is a popular programming language known for its ease and readability. I find Python particularly appealing due to its concise syntax and reduced code complexity compared to other languages like C++ (Comparing Python to Other Languages, 1997). It can be used for various tasks like creating websites, analyzing data, and building artificial intelligence (Applications for Python, 2023). Python offers many helpful tools and is widely used in different fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      The decision to migrate the C++ code to Python was driven by my goal of making the code available to a wider range of users who primarily work with Python. Recognizing that the original code was not in Python, I believed that offering multiple versions would be advantageous. Moreover, Python's simplicity and readability make it an ideal choice for beginners entering the programming realm. The concise syntax and reduced code complexity of Python also enable faster development.
    </p>
    <p>
      My translation of the code from C++ to Python highlights my competence in both languages and my ability to ensure the smooth functionality of the application. Being versatile in multiple programming languages is a valuable skill for aspiring software developers, demonstrating their worth to potential employers. By making the code accessible to a broader user base, its enhancement and potential utilization in various Python-centric applications are emphasized. This opens opportunities for the code to be utilized in diverse contexts where Python is the preferred programming language.
    </p>
    <p>
      Furthermore, I employed strategies for building collaborative environments by seeking feedback and input from diverse audiences. I engaged in peer code reviews, enabling different programmers to support the decision-making process and enhance the code's quality.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Python code brings several noteworthy enhancements compared to its C++ counterpart. It streamlines the code by removing the "using namespace std;" directive for a more concise structure. In doing so, I demonstrate my ability to design and deliver professional-quality oral, written, and visual communications that are coherent and technically sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Password verification in the CheckUserPermissionAccess() function is improved, with explicit return values for clarity. This showcases my skills in designing and evaluating computing solutions that solve a given problem using algorithmic principles and computer science practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      DisplayInfo() uses "\n" instead of std::endl, improving performance and highlighting my attention to technical details. This reflects my ability to use well-founded and innovative techniques, skills, and tools in computing practices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Python introduces robust error handling with try-except blocks, ensuring reliable user input validation. This demonstrates my proficiency in developing a security mindset that anticipates adversarial exploits and ensures enhanced security of data and resources.
    </p>
    <p>
      Moreover, I follow industry-specific standards and practices by importing the sys module and using sys.exit() for program termination. This further showcases my ability to develop professional-quality computer solutions that deliver value and accomplish industry-specific goals.
    </p>
    <p>
      To summarize the enhancements made, my transformation of the code from C++ to Python showcases my competence in multiple programming languages and my proficiency in employing strategies for building collaborative environments, designing and evaluating computing solutions, utilizing well-founded techniques and tools, and developing a security mindset. These factors play a crucial role in successful software development, emphasizing my skills and expertise in the field of computer science.
